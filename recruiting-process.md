# Interviewing With Us
Thanks for taking the time to interview with Aptible! We’re excited to get to know you throughout the process. We wrote this guide to help you prepare for your conversations with us, as well as to provide transparency about the hiring process at Aptible and why it is the way it is.

If you have questions at any point, please reach out to the hiring manager or main point of contact. We want to make the experience of interviewing with Aptible as delightful, efficient, fair, respectful, and transparent as possible.
## What We Look For
It’s not quite fair for us to jump right into the interview process without giving you some insight into what we’re looking for. Aptible is currently at an exciting stage in its growth, and our ability to achieve our mission is contingent on building an exceptional team and ensuring that team performs at a high level. You can read more about how we think about our team in our [Talent and Compensation Philosophy](about-aptible/talent.md).

Outside of role-specific competencies that hiring managers seek to test during the interview process, there are specific behaviors we look for in all candidates:

### Aptible Values
These specific behaviors are markers that a candidate will help our team maintain and improve upon our [values and culture](about-aptible/values.md). We think of our [values as verbs](https://twitter.com/simonsinek/status/1398040588025466881?lang=en), and we look for team members who will not only naturally make decisions that are consistent with our values but help us to expand our understanding of what makes a great Aptible team member.

[Read more about Aptible’s values here.](about-aptible/values.md)

We hope that by sharing our values not only do we help candidates understand whether Aptible might be a good fit for them, but also we help candidates prepare relevant examples and stories from their background and experience that demonstrate consistency with these values.

There’s obviously a lot of information to consume and remember, but if we were to summarize: to us, great candidates are those who focus on achieving the intended outcomes, not just getting the work done. They have a growth mindset, and are comfortable seeking feedback. They care – about our customers’, our teams’, and Aptible’s successes, just as much as their own. So we’d love for you to tell us how your experiences and background exemplify this description and might contribute to extending and improving Aptible’s culture.
## Getting Ready for Your Interviews
### Get to Know Aptible
Whether you’re simply browsing our open opportunities, approaching an introduction call with a hiring manager, or deep into our interview process, we recommend taking a few steps to get to who we are, and what we do. Here are some suggestions:
- Familiarize yourself with [Aptible](https://www.aptible.com/). We recommend checking out our [2021 Year in Review](https://www.aptible.com/p/2021-year-in-review/)!
- See our [Aptible Handbook](https://www.aptible.com/handbook/) and [Company](https://www.aptible.com/company/) Pages.
- See some recent posts on the Aptible [Blog](https://www.aptible.com/blog/).
### Expect Video Interviews
Our entire interview process is a reflection of how we work: “Remote-First”. This means that there are no in-person interviews, and everything is conducted over Zoom.

If you have access to a video camera on your devices, we strongly encourage you to turn your video on. We believe that seeing each others’ faces is important, because it directly fosters empathy and understanding.

In addition, please ensure that you have a stable WiFi connection and are set up in a quiet space, free of distractions. We want to be able to focus on you!

Please let us know if you’d benefit from interview accommodations. We’re happy to confidentially discuss your options and see how we may be able to assist.
## Our Interview Process
### Structured Interviews
We conduct Structured Interviews at Aptible, which means that we use the same methods to assess candidates who are being considered for the same role, because research shows that they can be predictive of candidate performance. For each open position, we use the same interview questions, grade candidate responses on the same scale, and make hiring decisions based on consistent, predetermined qualifications.

A typical process at Aptible might include the following steps:

1. An introduction to Aptible with the hiring manager (30 minutes via Zoom)
2. A resumé walk interview with an Aptible team member (45-60 minutes via Zoom)
3. A take-home work sample exercise (You will be compensated for completing this.)
4. A discussion-based interview with an Aptible team member (45-60 minutes via Zoom)
5. References
6. Offer

In most if not all conversations, we will make time for you to ask any questions – in fact, it’s strongly encouraged!
### Work Sample
We believe that the work sample exercise is an important part of the process, in that it gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your skills in a concrete way. We take the time to design these exercises such that they: a) give you a view into the actual work you'd do at Aptible, and b) are standardized, so every candidate is evaluated using the same criteria.

While you will be working on sample projects relevant to Aptible, work samples are not “free labor” for Aptible. Most importantly, you’ll be compensated for your time completing the work sample.
### Values Interviews
At Aptible, our values form the foundation of our commitment to achieving [Aptible’s mission](mission-strategy.md). We believe that alignment with our values does not imply a homogenous culture, but instead, a dynamic one. By this, we acknowledge that our values allow for an infinite number of ways for each person to contribute to our culture and our mission through their individual skills, perspectives and experiences. To that end, regardless of function or seniority, we ask a standard set of questions that help us understand your motivations and alignment with Aptible's values. We encourage you to review and give thought to them in advance and be prepared to share relevant, specific examples from your past professional experience.

It's important to note that we're not looking for a 'fit' for our culture: We use this interview to understand how you'll contribute to our culture and help move it forward with your own unique perspective and experiences.
### References
Lastly, Aptible conducts calls with current or past colleagues who have directly supervised you and/or can speak directly to your work. We will ask you to provide email addresses and brief descriptions of your working relationship with 3-4 References. A member of our hiring team will email them to find a time to connect, then follow up with you once the calls are completed.
## Interviewing FAQs
### How long does your process take?
Our typical interview process takes place within 2-3 weeks. The timing of this may vary depending on accommodations, holidays, etc. If you have any constraints, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate them.
### Is there a dress code for remote interviews?
We are a casual bunch. Feel free to wear something that you are comfortable in! For example, a plain tee shirt, button-down, or sweater works just fine.
### Help! I have a scheduling conflict, what do I do?
If you need to reschedule due to an unforeseen emergency, we’re here to help. Please email the hiring manager or your main point of contact as soon as possible.
### I'm outside of the US, will I still be compensated for my work exercise?
Yes! For all candidates who complete our work sample, you will be compensated for your time regardless of your geographic region. We use [bill.com](https://www.bill.com/) for all work exercise compensation, and you will be sent instructions from our Finance team to get that set up.
